# Analysim

Analysim is a free online web platform enabling researchers to analyze
and share data by providing interactive visualizations, and
collaborate with others.  The open platform is specialized for working
with high-dimensional data sets such as those constructed via
computational modeling.  Analysim also allows you to run custom
analysis on any type of data.

## Installation
Clone the [Analysim Repository](https://github.com/soft-eng-practicum/AnalySim) from [GitHub](http://www.github.com) so that you have the project locally.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/soft-eng-practicum/AnalySim.git
```

### Required software for development

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [ASP.Net 6.0 command-line interface (CLI)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (Required)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or other editor
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for testing API calls
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for testing deployment
- [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15) or use online [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) for browsing Azure Blob Storage 

### Installing Angular package dependencies

After you have cloned the Analysim repository on your local machine,
use the terminal to navigate to the
`AnalySim\src\Analysim.Web\ClientApp` folder and run the following
command.

```sh
npm install
```

#### Running the project

You will need to get the `appsettings.json` file(s) from the project
admins in order to connect to the database.  Put these files under the
`src/Analysim.Web` folder.

**Step 1:**

In **Visual Studio Code** (or other editor), open up the Analysim
project folder.  Using a terminal, navigate to
`src\Analysim.Web\ClientApp` and run the following command (also works
from Command Line):

```
ng serve -o
```

**Step 2:**

Next, in **Visual Studio**, open up the `AnalySim.sln` file.  Click on
the run to start the project.  Once you have completed both steps,
your project should be up and running! 

Alternatively, without Visual Studio, you use .Net CLI from command
line by first navigating into the `src\Analysim.Web` folder:

```sh
dotnet run
```

## Deploying

The overall process of deployment is explained in the tutorial video on
[deploying ASP.Net on Heroku using Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQMT4al2Grg:).

### Prerequisites
1. Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Download [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
3. Enable Docker Support
   
### Publish .Net project and create Docker image

*Note:* Prepend `sudo` before each `docker` and `heroku` (except `dotnet`) command on Mac/Linux.

4. Publish *Analysim.Web* to the local folder (keep default location for folder), which can also be done on the command line: 
    ```bash
    dotnet publish --configuration Release
    ```
1. Create the Docker image by running the following in the base project folder (e.g. `Analysim/`) :
    ```bash
    docker build -t analysim-dev -f deploy/Dockerfile .
    ```
1. Test image locally, by running it:
   ```bash
   docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:80:80/tcp analysim-dev
   ```
   You can test by opening a browser to http://localhost:80 (not https).

### Register and upload Docker image to Heroku

*Note:* Prepend `sudo` before each `docker` and `heroku` (except `dotnet`) command on Mac/Linux.

Run the following commands in terminal to update Heroku deployment ([more info](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime)):

1. Login to Heroku and container service (if using `sudo`, you may need to copy-paste into browser):
   ```bash
   heroku login
   heroku container:login
   ```
1. Tag the image name on Heroku's container registry:
   ```bash
   docker tag analysim-dev registry.heroku.com/analysim-dev
   docker push registry.heroku.com/analysim-dev
   ```
1. Change to the `deploy/` folder and re-build image using Heroku CLI:
   ```bash
   cd deploy
   heroku container:push web -a analysim-dev --context-path=..
   heroku container:release web -a analysim-dev
   ```
